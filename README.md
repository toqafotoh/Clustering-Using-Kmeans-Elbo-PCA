# Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-means Clustering and PCA

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to segment them into different groups based on their spending habits and income. We leverage the K-means clustering algorithm for grouping and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to enhance clustering results.

## Dataset
The dataset contains valuable insights into customer spending behavior, including their annual income and spending score. You can access and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Steps
1. **Load the Dataset:** Begin by importing and loading the dataset into your code.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gain insights into the data by visually exploring it using scatter plots and histograms.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the data by scaling it and addressing missing values.
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
5. **Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters:** Use the elbow method to determine the suitable number of clusters for K-means.
6. **K-means Clustering:** Apply the K-means algorithm to cluster similar customers into segments.
7. **Visualization:** Visualize the clustered results using scatter plots and other visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis.
4. Explore the generated visualizations to understand the customer segments better.
